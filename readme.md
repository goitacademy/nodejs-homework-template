## GoIT Node.js Course Template Homework.

Make a fork of this repository to do homework (2-6). The fork will create a repository on your account at http://github.com

Add a mentor as a collaborator.

Create a new branch for each homework assignment.

- hw02
- hw03
- hw04
- hw05
- hw06

Each new branch for the task should be created from the master branch.

After completing the homework on your branch, do a pull request (PR). Then add a mentor to review the code. Only after the mentor approves the PR can you merge the branch with the homework to the master branch.

Carefully read the mentor's comments. Correct the comments and make a commit on the branch with the homework. The changes will automatically appear in the PR after you post the commit with the corrections on GitHub. After the corrections, add the mentor to the code review again.

- Provide a link to the PR when submitting the homework.
- JS code is readable and understandable, Prettier is used for formatting.

### Commands:

- `npm start` &mdash; starts the server in production mode.
- `npm run start:dev` &mdash; starts the server in development mode
- `npm run lint` &mdash; runs a code checker with ESLint, should be executed before each PR and fixes all linter errors
- `npm lint:fix` &mdash; same as the above, but also automatically corrects simple errors.

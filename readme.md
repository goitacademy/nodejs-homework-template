# REST API for Contact Collection

This repository contains a RESTful API for managing a collection of contacts. The API is built using Node.js and Express, providing endpoints for performing CRUD operations on the contacts.
It uses MongoDB as the database for storing contact information. The API follows best practices and includes proper error handling, data validation using the Joi package, and integration with MongoDB using Mongoose. This project also implements user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It provides endpoints for user registration, login, token verification middleware, user logout, pagination, filtration by favorites, and subscription update.

> This repository assumes the usage of Postman, a popular API development and testing tool, for interacting with the REST API.

### Validation

To ensure data integrity, the API performs validation on the incoming data using the Joi and mongoose schema for model.

For adding a new contact:

    All fields (name, email, phone) are required.
    The email field must match the regular expression to ensure it is a valid email format.

For updating a contact:

    At least one field (name, email, phone) must be provided.
    If the data fails validation, JSON with the key {"message": "value must contain at least one of [name, email, phone]"} will be returned.

For user registration:

    All fields (name, email, phone) are required.
    The email must match the email regular expression.
    The password must have a minimum length of 6 characters.

For user login:

    The email field is required and must match the email regular expression.
    The password field is required and must have a minimum length of 6 characters.

For updating a user's subscription:

    The subscription field is required and must be one of the values: "starter", "pro", or "business".

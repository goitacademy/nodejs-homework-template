GoIT Node.js Course Template Homework
Fork this repository to complete homework assignments (2-6).
Forking will create a repository on your http://github.com account.

Add your mentor as a collaborator.

Create a new branch for each homework assignment:

hw02
hw03
hw04
hw05
hw06
Each new branch should be created from the master branch.

After completing the homework assignment in your branch, create a pull request (PR) and add your mentor for code review. Only after the mentor approves the PR, you can merge the branch with the homework assignment into the master branch.

Carefully read your mentor's comments. Fix any issues and commit the changes to your branch with the homework assignment. Changes will automatically be pulled into the PR after you submit the commit with the fixes to GitHub.

After making the fixes, add your mentor again for code review.

Requirements:

Provide a link to the PR when submitting your homework.
JavaScript code should be clean and understandable, using Prettier for formatting.
Commands:

npm start — start the server in production mode.
npm run start:dev — start the server in development mode.
npm run lint — run the code check with eslint. You should run this command before each PR and fix all eslint errors.
npm lint:fix — same as above, but with automatic fixes for simple errors.
